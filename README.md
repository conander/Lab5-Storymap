# Oreogn Ski Resort Storymap
This story map is intended to highlight four of the ten ski and snowboarding areas in Oregon.

It starts by showing an overview of the state with markers depicting the locations of the four
resorts in relation to each other.

The following scenes go through the four resorts from north to south and provide an ESRI satellite
image followed by a topographic basemap with ski runs (provided by Thunderfrost). Each resort scene
includes informational quotes from their individual websites (links included).
