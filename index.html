                <p>Oregon is home to ten ski and snowboard areas that provide diverse destinations for skiers of all experience
                    levels. This storymap highlights four of the ten resorts within Oregon’s Cascade Range including:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Mount Hood Meadows</li>
                      <li>Timberline Lodge</li>
                      <li>Hoodoo Ski Area</li>

                <h2>Mt. Hood Meadows</h2>
                <p>"Mt. Hood Meadows Ski Resort operates on a special use permit on the Mt. Hood National Forest,
                    offering some of the most spectacular skiing and snowboarding in the Northwest. The resort is just 90
                    minutes away from Portland, and it delivers a big mountain experience you'd expect to travel much
                    farther to enjoy. The resort sprawls across Mt. Hood's southeast flank, the sunny, wind-protected side of
                    Mt. Hood. Meadows' playful terrain welcomes and challenges all levels of skiers and snowboarders.</p>
                <p>The variety of Meadows terrain is what makes it so unique and popular. The wide-open terrain off of the
                    Cascade Express (voted most popular cruising terrain in Oregon) offers incredible panoramic views half-
                    way across Oregon from it's 7,300 foot elevation. Advanced skiers and snowboarders seek out the steeps in
                    the front bowls, or drop in to the seemingly endless pitch of powder-filled Heather Canyon. Explore the
                    double black steeps, gladed tree runs and cliffs through access gates into the Private Reserve and S&R
                    Cliffs! There's an additional 1,700 vertical for hikers who want to drop into the double blacks of Super
                    Bowl above Heather, to bring the total vertical limit available in just one run to almost 4,500 feet.
                    Beginners learn on the gentle slopes of Buttercup and the Ballroom Carpet. Meadows is known for having some
                    of the best terrain in the Northwest!"</p>
